## Abstract

Some recent efforts have attempted to abuse the web’s established status
as a platform
by associating incubating technologies
and suggesting it as a versioned evolution.
We declare this as harmful
and explain why this goes against the principles of the web.

## The modern web does not need versioning

The web has been in [constant evolution](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/evergreen-web/)
as a feature - not having unnecessary discussions
about what feature should be available in what milestone
allows the community to focus on the merits
of each technical contribution to the web
in a distributed, non-political manner,
allowing it to evolve to where it is now. 

Some years ago, there was a phase of the web
where new standard development was stagnant,
and the web was not evolving from a state
of a collection of interlinked static documents.
To counter this stagnation, there was a movement
dubbed “Web 2.0” to rejuvenate the web
into its next stage of evolution.
This idea included concepts
such as interactive web applications,
arguably ushering in what we now think of as the modern web.
However, the 2.0 moniker was not intended to be
considered a version in the sense that software is versioned.

The web as a platform never has and never will be
versioned at a platform level.
While independent specifications have versions, collectively,
all of the technologies that form the web
have complex inter-specification dependencies driven by a large community,
and this nature effectively makes it
intractable to declare a version.
Efforts such as [Baseline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility)
are distinct from the concept of versioning,
as this is fundamentally a concept of an unversioned snapshot
that has interoperability guarantees.

It’s, therefore, inappropriate and potentially confusing
to the ecosystem, for the web standards community
to associate web feature sets
with a version number in the traditional sense of software versioning.

## Incremental evolution as the path forward

The web is a stable platform.
Enhancements should always be incremental,
in a positive direction (leave the web better than you found it),
while breaking as little
(if possible, ideally zero - for example,
through [polyfill prototyping](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/polyfills/))
content as possible.
The only reasonable way to do this
is to improve it through incremental, well-isolated contributions.
This is especially important
since unshipping a feature from the web
requires significantly more effort than shipping the feature.

## Contributions are either part of the web or they are not

As with any software platform, there are two ways to land a technical proposal:

1. Articulate the technical merits of your proposal
   with clear use cases and get it integrated into the platform through consensus.
2. Fork the platform.

As the web is a standard-governed platform,
we only acknowledge proposals that fall under the first criteria.
Associating a group of non-standardized technologies
and claiming it as a specific version or evolution of the web
effectively is going in the direction of the latter -
and is false marketing, especially if your fork claims to be another web.

## Conclusion

For the above-mentioned reasons,
we believe that any trend towards versioning the web is harmful,
and any versioning happening out in the wild is unsanctioned and harmful.
There is [one web](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/#oneweb).
